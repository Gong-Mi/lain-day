Cyberia is an unusual bar. It operates as an Italian restaurant in the morning and an underground club at night.

Unlike typical bars that rely on alcohol sales and would refuse entry to children, this place doesn't. Based on my observation, this bar might be a contact point or a rendezvous spot.

More importantly, you'll occasionally notice someone buying a coffee for a stranger. They'll exchange a few words, and then the stranger will leave.

If someone casually mentions 'that bar,' they are likely referring to this one.
