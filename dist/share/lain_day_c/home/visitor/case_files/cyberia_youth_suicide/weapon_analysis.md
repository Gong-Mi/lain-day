### Weapon Analysis Report

*   **Weapon:** A crude replica resembling a **Glock 17** pistol.

*   **Construction:**
    *   The frame appears to be an amateur build, possibly 3D-printed, with low mechanical strength.
    *   Lacks professional heat treatment or cold working.
    *   The barrel is a simple, smoothbore pipe (no rifling).
    *   No serial number or manufacturer markings are present.

*   **Scene Details:**
    *   Ballistic trajectory indicates the weapon was fired twice.
    *   The scene shows a clear ballistic trajectory, but no projectile or fragments were recovered.

*   **Forensic Contradictions:**
    *   **No Casings:** Despite resembling a semi-automatic pistol, no shell casings were recovered at the scene.
    *   **No Gunshot Residue (GSR):** No traces of conventional GSR were found on the suspect's person or clothing.
    *   **Vanished Projectile:** A trajectory exists, but the projectile itself is missing.

*   **Conclusion:**
    *   The weapon is an untraceable, anomalous firearm. Its method of operation is inconsistent with its known design, suggesting the use of an unknown, experimental technology.
