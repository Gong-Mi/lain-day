Lain's Body Report

Summary: The individual's physiological characteristics fundamentally diverge from known human biological models, presenting multiple contradictory biological signals.

*   Skeletal System:
    *   Knee joints are primarily cartilaginous, with no obvious signs of ossification or calcification.
    *   Bone density is abnormally high.
    *   Bone surfaces are smooth, with no traces of previously existing growth plates (epiphyseal plates).
    *   No metabolic activity indicative of bone remodeling (dissolution and regeneration) was detected.

*   Microbial System:
    *   The digestive tract lacks common local types of commensal bacteria, but contains an unknown, functionally monolithic bacterial flora.

*   Immune System:
    *   Blood tests show antibody reactions to various common non-vaccinated diseases, indicating a "natural exposure history" for its immune system.
    *   However, the body completely lacks antibodies against common mandatory vaccines in the Japanese region (e.g., BCG, MMR, etc.).

*   Developmental Characteristics:
    *   The oral cavity still retains some deciduous teeth, which is severely inconsistent with its apparent age.

*   Nervous System:
    *   Higher cognitive functions (e.g., interpretation and understanding of abstract knowledge) are highly coherent and surpass age-appropriate levels.
    *   However, motor coordination is inconsistent, showing significant delay and mismatch.

Conclusion:
The individual exhibits a profound "fabricated history" chimeric characteristic. Its immune system "remembers" a natural illness history, yet the absence of vaccine antibodies conclusively proves that it has never truly lived or grown up in Japanese society. This contradiction cannot be explained by any known scientific theory. The individual's mode of existence appears to follow entirely different biological, and even physical, principles.
