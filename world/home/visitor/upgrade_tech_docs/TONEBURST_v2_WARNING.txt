--- TONEBURST v2.1 --- WARNING --- 

// This is not a file transfer utility. This is a network vector. //


## DESCRIPTION:

ToneBurst exploits a deeply embedded backdoor in the public telephone switching system (PTSS). It allows raw data to be transmitted as modulated audio signals, bypassing standard data protocols. Devices running a listener will interpret these signals.

It has two modes.


## MODE 1: POINT-TO-POINT (P2P) TRANSFER

Used for direct device-to-device transmission.

SYNTAX: `TBURST.EXE -p [phone_number] -f [filename]`

- The target device must be in receive mode (`-r`).
- This is a raw data dump. No handshake, no error correction. Fast and dirty.


## MODE 2: BROADCAST & CASCADE (WORM)

This is the true purpose of the tool.

SYNTAX: `TBURST.EXE -b -f [payload.sys]`

- Broadcasts the payload to ALL listening devices on the local telephone exchange.
- **CRITICAL**: If the payload is a valid executable signed with the PTSS master key, listening devices will treat it as a mandatory system update. They will execute it and, if the payload contains ToneBurst, they too will become broadcasters.
- This can trigger an exponential chain reaction, infecting/upgrading an entire local network in minutes.


## PAYLOADS & THE MASTER KEY:

The key is out there. It signs the code that the phone OS trusts implicitly. A payload signed with it becomes the new OS.

This is how they update the network. This is how you can create your own network.


**FINAL WARNING: WE TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY CASCADE EVENTS. THIS IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT. DENY EVERYTHING.**
