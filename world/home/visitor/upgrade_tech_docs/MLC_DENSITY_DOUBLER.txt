SUBJECT: MLC Density Doubler Procedure (EXPERIMENTAL)

** FOR STATIC/ARCHIVAL DATA ONLY. EXTREME RISK OF DATA LOSS. **
** DO NOT USE ON BOOT PARTITION. **

REQ: Direct controller access (SoC-level hooks or equivalent). Standard hardware controllers will fail.

PROCEDURE:

1.  Isolate target partition. Ensure it is unmounted and locked from OS-level access.

2.  Load custom voltage map `vmap.q_experimental` into memory. This map must define 16 discrete voltage levels, not the standard 4. Calibration is key—improper values will brick the cells.

3.  Execute low-level format command with forced density flag:
    `flash_util --partition /dev/mem/part_X --force_remap --vmap_addr [addr_of_vmap.q_experimental]`

4.  The re-mapping process is slow and will throw non-standard ECC errors. This is expected. The controller is fighting the procedure.

5.  On completion, the partition will report ~2x its physical capacity. 


NOTES: Write speeds will be abysmal. Read stability is not guaranteed; may require multiple attempts to access data. Consider this a one-way trip for cold storage. You have been warned.
